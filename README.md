# About
A clone of the Flappy Bird game made with the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library. Game recreated for the purpose of learning more about neural networks and game development.

# How to run
There is an executable for windows in the "Game.zip" folder

# How to build
  ## Requirements
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
  - [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
  - [c++ compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)  
  * Follow this [tutorial](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php) for more detail

  ## Cloning
   ```bash
  # Clone repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/Thalisson-Alves/Flappy-Bird
  
  # Go to Flappy Bird directory

  1. Type the make command of the compiler you are using. For example type "mingw32-make" if you use MinGW.
  1. Run the executable :)
